Exercise 1)
a) the plotted paths are in the code submission.
`Wavefront/plots`

b) 
world1 -> 81 cells of 0.25 size 
world2 -> 183 cells of 0.25 size

d) The paths would pass through more cells, 
but that doesnt mean that we would travel more distance.
Because cell size is decreased.
We may be able to find a closer path in a narrower passage, 
so we may get there by traveling less distance.

e) The gradient descent planner was harder to implement
Because of tuning. Wavefront was much easier to implement.
gradient descent generate solution faster than but it wasn't optimal, 
Wavefront generates the best path w.r.t grid but takes longer to generate.
